# Victoria

Victoria, an mobile application which mimick central bank digital currency, which allows conversion between HKD and CBDC, peer-to-peer payment and account information checking.

## How we get inspired
To improvise the evolution of currency, from coin to note, and now to digital currency, we are proposing for the HKMA to adopt CBDC implementation to promote cashless society. As compared to Project Inthathon-LionRock with regards to increase Hong Kong’s financial stability, we are putting strong emphasis on cash to CBDC migration. Therefore, we create an Minimal Viable Product (MVP) mimicking CBDC wallet, that was built on <a href="https://flutter.dev/?gclid=CjwKCAiA6aSABhApEiwA6Cbm_7PgB0T5hkRn1noadXlxn3OH5lmWib2qB6nnorXO_bZXZ2KDk2zEvRoCZ1oQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Flutter</a>.
